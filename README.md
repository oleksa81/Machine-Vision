# Machine-Vision

*This repository includes assignment from the course*

This course introduces concepts and techniques in machine vision. It covers a variety of
image processing techniques for the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for real-
world applications, such as optical character recognition, face detection and recognition,
motion estimation, human tracking, and gesture recognition. Topics include basic image
enhancement, corner and edge detection, image morphology, linear and non-linear
filters, image transformations, camera models, two-dimensional and three-dimensional
image geometry, clustering and segmentation, classification, object recognition and Bag-
of-Words models, image texture, shape analysis, and tracking
